# Tasks

## Import Libraries and Define Global Variables

```python
N, M = 8, 8
n_players = 2
marks = [['B', 'W'], ['KB', 'KW']]
count_cells, grid, is_king, possible_cells = [], [], [], []
```

## Display the Grid

```python
#This function prints the grid of Draughts as the game progresses
def print_grid():
    print("Player 1: %c  vs  Player 2: %c" % (marks[0][0], marks[0][1]))
    print('--' + '--' * 2 * M + '--')
    for i in range(N):
        print(end='|  ')
        for j in range(M):
            cell = str(grid[i][j]) + (' ' * (2 - len(grid[i][j])))
            print(cell, end='  ')
        print(end='|')
        print()
        print('--' + '--' * 2 * M + '--')
    for i in range(n_players):
        print('Player %c has %d cells'% (marks[0][i], count_cells[i]))
    print('--' + '------' * (M-1))
```

## Read User Input

```python
#This function checks if given cell is empty or not
def check_empty(i, j):
    pass

#This function checks if given position is valid or not
def check_valid_position(i, j):
    pass

#This function checks if given cell is chosen or not
def check_chosen(i1, j1, i2, j2):
    pass

#This function reads a valid position input
def read_input(player):
    i1, j1, i2, j2 = map(int, input('Enter the source and target points: ').split())
    while not check_valid_position(i1, j1) or not check_valid_position(i2, j2) or \
          check_empty(i1, j1) or not check_empty(i2, j2) or not check_chosen(i1, j1, i2, j2):
        i1, j1, i2, j2 = map(int, input('Enter a valid source and target points: ').split())
    return i1, j1, i2, j2
```

## Check the Game Win State

```python
#This function checks if the game has a win state or not
def check_win():
    pass
```

## Check the Game Tie State

```python
#This function checks if the game has a tie state or not
def check_player_ability():
    pass
```

## Move the Given Player Cell

```python
#This function sets the given mark to the given cell
def set_cell(i, j, mark):
    pass

#This function moves the given player form the source cell to the target cell
def move_cell(i1, j1, i2, j2, player):
    pass
```

## Generate the Possible Cells to be Chosen in the Attack and Defense Cases

```python
#This function generates the possible cells to be chosen in the attack case
def generate_possible_cells_attack_case(player):
    pass

#This function generates the possible cells to be chosen in the defence case
def generate_possible_cells_defense_case(player):
    pass
```

## Generate the Possible Cells to be Chosen

```python
#This function generates the possible cells to be chosen
def generate_possible_cells(player):
    global possible_cells
    possible_cells = []
    generate_possible_cells_attack_case(player)
    if possible_cells: return
    generate_possible_cells_defense_case(player)
    possible_cells = list(set(possible_cells))
```

## Mark and Unmark the Possible Cells

```python
#This function marks the possible cells in the grid
def mark_possible_cells():
    pass

#This function unmarks the possible cells in the grid
def unmark_possible_cells():
    pass
```

## Clear the Grid

```python
#This function clears the game structures
def grid_clear():
    pass
```

## Main Function

```python
#Take turn of the given player
def take_turn(player):
    #Read an input position from the player
    i1, j1, i2, j2 = read_input(player)
    #Set the player mark in the input position
    move_cell(i1, j1, i2, j2, player)

#Get the next Player number
def next_player(player):
    return 1 - player

#MAIN FUNCTION

    print("Draughts Game!")
